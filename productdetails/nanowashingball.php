   Washing Ball is a detergent Saving Product to Protect ecological environment and Prevent   damage of Clothes &amp; Skin trouble by remaining detergent in clothes.</p>
      <p><strong> Features Of Washing Ball. </strong><br />
        It is designed with round shape in order to minimize the damage of Laundry. <br />
        It is very hygienic through the influence of its excellent antibacterial effect ( Eliminate Bacteria and Mold etc ) to the inner of washer capacity and laundry as well as increase the cleaning effect of water. 
        Also this can clean clothes and laundry without any detergents by lowering surface or Interfacial tension.<br />
        This rubbing effect of water and laundry  increase the cleaning and deodorizing power by activated water through the influence of wavelength energy of far infra red rays and etc which it is contained functional ceramic ball to emit.<br />
        As compared with normal washing Process, we can obtain following effects by reducing the use of synthetic detergent water saving, Electric energy saving and time saving , Etc. So this is very economical and pro-environmental. In Addition, this is helpful to prevent the damage of clothes and skin trouble to be able to occur by remaining in clothes after washing.<br />

        <strong>Benefits of Washing Balls<br />
        </strong> Wonder Washing Ball Is The Latest Invention In Washing Technology<br />
        No detergent needed , chemical free wash keeps your clothes soft &amp; tender,No color fading,increases the life of clothes.<br />
        What is a Washing Ball Washing ball is an ideal substitute of washing powder, with strong<br />
          decontamination ability and not harmful for clothing. Washing ball is round plastic ball,inner is packed
          with multifunctional washing balls.<br />
          How does it work : Wonder washing balls are made of natural ceramics and manufactured in a<br />
          specialized high heat process. Once the washing balls are placed into water filled washing machine, the<br />
          water molecules go through an ionization reaction and generate hydroxyl ions which have hydrophillic<br />
          and hydrophobic properties, and become surfactant molecules which remove dirt. Because on ionization<br />
          and reaction with far infrared ray, water loses its surface tension and attains penetration, dispersion and
          soaking properties, becoming the surfactant.<br />
      Further more, water disolved by the washing ball has improved washown anctibacterial, deodorization, skin care,and improved water quality.</p>
