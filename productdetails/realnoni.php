      <p><strong>NONI Really Indian </strong><br />
        Though international in character, NONI is not a foreign food. NONI is very much Indian. It is totally Swadeshi. The botanical name for the genus Morinda citrifolia L. was derived from the two Latin words Morus, which means Mulberry, and indicus which means Indian. (Hence, the English name Indian Mulberry). The<br />
        Species name citrifolia indicates the resemblance of the plant foliage to that of circus species. It is exciting to note that even the very name of the plant endorses its Indian origin. Respected for its<br />
        Health benefits, it has references both in Ayurveda and Siddha<br />
        Texts of our Indian Medicinal Systems. The tree is known as Ach in Sanskrit. </p>
      <p><strong>Suitable for all-Young or Old</strong><br />
        It is a preventive and protective food Supplement that works at the cellular level. It is 100% vegetarian and totally herbal. Hence, absolutely no Side-Effects. It is completely safe for all.<br />
        It should be a part of everyones daily diet because of its exceptional nutritional value. It is truly mother Natures Gift to Humanity. Let us realize its benefits and share those with others around us.<br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Noni : The Cell Rejuvenator</strong><br />
        Our body is made of micro-units called cells. Healthy cells lead to healthy tissues, healthy tissues lead to healthy organs, healthy organs lead to healthy systems and healthy systems lead to healthy body. Hence, the health of the cells is essential for a body to be healthy. Noni,<br />
        Being the best nutritional supplement works at this cell level in order to make these fundamental units healthy and thereby makes us live healthier.</p>
      <p><strong>Noni Works as a De-toxifier</strong><br />
        Every cell in the body is like a house with doors and windows. When you have to drive a car into a garage you need to open the large door. The same goes to on in our body if we have to absorb a larger protein molecule, we need to open a larger pore if we have to use it. Our cells are made up of micro-particles such as neutrons, protons, cytoplasm, golgi bodies, etc. which are genetically engineered to work well in a chemical &acirc;&euro;&ldquo;free environment. But because we live in a chemically polluted environment, many types of toxins and pollutants are going into our body. They, wrapping the cells day by day, have formed multiple layers around the cells walls, <br />
        Thus lead to the closure or shrinking of the pores of the cell walls. Consequently, the inter-cellular communication is prevented, the cells are damaged and they forget their purposes, they neither do their regular functions correctly nor efficiently.<br />
        Noni being the powerful De-toxifier removes the toxic layers on the cell walls and it enlarges the pores of the cell walls. This enlargement allows for larger chains of peptides (amino acids or proteins) to be admitted into the cell and to feed us better. If these chains are not used they become waste <br />
        And precious source of energy is lost by going to far or being eliminated. But because of Nonis detoxification process, the cells resume their communications, are reminded of their proposes and they are rejuvenated with greater strength and life. Now the cells are able to assimilate the nutrients and medicines easily. They are strengthened and healed at their roots. This is the basis if Nonis cellular activity that causes the enhancement of efficacy of the medicine.</p>
      <p><strong>Noni Works as a Protein Regulator and Activator </strong><br />
        Thanks to Dr. Ralph Heinickie who found out that Morinda citrifolia fruit is a rich resource of large molecules called Proxeronine (pro-zair-o-neen). Proxeronine combines with enzymes in the body to form an essential substance known as Xeronine (zair-o-neen). Once Xeronine is formed, it combines with many proteins in the body that require Xeronine to function. Not all proteins, but many vital proteins, acting as hormones, antibodies, and enzymes need Xeronine to carry out their duties.<br />
        What do proteins do and why are they important? Proteins give structure to hair, skin and bones. They allow the transport of chemicals and <br />
        Nutrients through the cell membrane. Priteins also act as hormones, <br />
        Coordinating all bodily processes at the molecular level. Proteins act as antibodies and incapacitate foreign bodily invaders such as viruses. They also act as enzymes and facilitate all chemical production in the body. Many of these proteins cannot function without Xeronine, Proxeronine, which is rich in Noni produces that Xeronine.</p>
      <p><strong>Why is a Proxeronine-Rich-Supplement important in our diet?</strong><br />
        Some reasons include the loss of micro-nutrients from the soil and poor nutrition in our diet. Even illness, a highly active or stressful lifestyle and aging plays an increased demand on proteins. In order to meet these demands and keep the body healthy, we need to increase the supply of Proxeronine by regulating drinking Noni. This helps us overcome low levels of Xeronine in our bodies and restores healthy protein assimilation.<br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>Noni works as a Safe Pain-reliever</strong><br />
        Scientists only recently have discovered that there are actually two types of COX enzymes: COX 1 and COX 2. Research shows that in the body, the CXO 2 enzyme is largely responsible for causing pain and inflammation. Injury, disease, and trauma cause COX 2 enzymes to produce prosta-glandins, which cause pain and inflammation. In contrast to the COX 2 enzyme, the COX 1 enzyme is responsible for protecting the bodys stomach lining and kidneys. COX1 enzymes continually produce protective prosta-glandins. When taken over long period of time, traditional medication for chronic pain and inflammation by way of Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like Aspirin and lbuprofen, inhabit the enzymatic activity of both COX1 and COX2. This inhibition of the COX2 enzyme reduces the prostaglandins that cause pain and inflammation throughout the body, but over time, it also restrains the COX1 enzyme from producing the prostaglandins that protect the stomach lining. This can result in major problems, such as ulcera and colitis, in the bodys digestive system. The discovery of COX2 created frenzy in the pharmaceutical world-everyone want to find a substance that would inhabit COX2 without harming the bodys production of COX 1. Exciting scientific findings from carefully conducted research done in an independent laboratory shows that Noni selectively inhabits the CPX 2 enzyme while allowing the COX1 enzyme to continue functioning.<br />
        Some scientists believe that a selective COX 2 inhibitor could help with menstrual pain and help prevent cancers of the colon, esophagus, skin, and bladder. Even those who have been diagnosed with Alzheimers may benefit from a selective C0X 2 inhibitor.</p>
      <p><strong>Noni works as a Cancer Inhibitor </strong><br />
        Nonis effect on cancer most likely deals with the fact that both Noni and cancer work on a cellular level. In other words, Noni enhances cellular structure while cancer, of course, destroys it. One of the Nonis key components , proxeronine, is sent to &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick&acirc;&euro;&#157; cells within the body by the Golgi apparatus and reticuloendothelium. Thesr sick cells attract Proxeronine and an enzyme, Proxeroninease. The interaction creates Xeronine , the cellular enhancer. Several other studies have been performed in laboratories in order to validate Morinda citrifolias cancer-fighting abilities. In one such study, four Japanese scientists injected RAS cells (cell that are precursors to many malignant growths) with a substance called Damnacanthal found in Morinda citrifolia. They observed that the injection significantly inhabited the RAS cells from reproducing. Proxeronine and Damnacanthal are substances within Morinda citrifolia that are believed to be anti-cancer agents.<br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>NONI works as a Healthy, Immune System Promoter</strong><br />
        Research has shown that if the immune system starts to turn against itself-perhaps the result of an auto-immune disorder-it may cause a complete obliteration of the pancreas beta cells or at least a reduction in the number of functioning beta cells, this affects the effectiveness of the bodys insulin. Current studies have revealed that Noni helps promoting a healthy immune system by either enhancing an already functioning system or by stimulating a sluggish one. In addition, as described earlier, Noni is believed to fortify and maintain cell structure. This can be accomplished by Noni acting as an adaptogen that can aid &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick&acirc;&euro;&#157; cells in repairing themselves. This could apply to diabetes by either helping malfunctioning beta cells in the pancreas or by aiding the cells that are unsuccessfully trying to receive and use the glucose in the blood. Besides, Noni has a low Glycolic Index Glycolic index refers to a method of classification by which a number is assigned to food based on how they affect blood sugar levels. Food that contain the same amount of total carbohydrates may have a different Glycolic index. Fried Chicken, for example, have a higher glycolic effect on the body than carrots; kidney beans blood increase blood sure levels more significantly than soya beans, because of its higher glycolic value. The glycolic effect of foods can indicate, as many researchers have found, potential risks than the acute blood sugar levels. Noni has a very low glycolic index and hence it reduces the risks of chronic conditions of diabetics;</p>
      <p><strong>Noni works as a Blood Pressure Stabilizer </strong><br />
        The reasons for Nonis reported success in helping with high blood pressure are muti-faceted. First of all, Morinda citrifolia contains scopoletin, which has been scientifically proven to dilate blood vessels resulting in lower blood pressure. A second reason that many use Noni for high blood pressure is that Noni helps stimulate the bodys production of nitric oxide, a chemical which allows the blood vessels to dilate healthy cell structure within the circulatory system.</p>
      <p><strong>Noni works as an Adaptogen </strong><br />
        The following is an example of how an adaptogen works. When the body puts out too much thyroid hormone, it is called hyperthyroidism. People with this condition are nervous, sweat a lot, lose weight, and have too much energy. An adaptogen, as found in the in the constituents of Noni assist in decreasing the abnormally high amount of thyroid hormone production and return the body to normal thyroid function, called euthyroidism. On the other hand, people who produce too little thyroid hormones are sluggish, tired, gain weight easily, have brittle fingermails, and often suffer from constipation. This condition is called hypothyroidism . Again, an adaptogen, such as Noni, could help increase the bodys production of the thyroid hormone and bring the body back to homeostasis, or normal balance</p>
      <p><strong>What is Noni acts as the adaptogen and specifically how does it work within the body? </strong><br />
        According to Heinicke-Solomon (H-S) theory, Noni is digested then released into the bodys bloodstream mainly as Proxeronine (P), Proxeronine travels into the cytoplasm of the bodys cells and accumulates in their Golgi Apparatus (GA). Within the GA, Proxerronine combines with different body biochemicals such as hormones, enzymes, Serotonin, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and other elements. The combination of Proxeronine and the other biochemicals are in specific and varied combinations depending on how the bodys homeostasis is out of alignment.<br />
        The GA acts as an &acirc;&euro;&oelig;assembler&acirc;&euro;&#157; combining just the right amounts of Proxeronine with the right proportions of the different biochemical. The GA then packages it, addresses it, and mails it to the addresses of the particular &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick&acirc;&euro;&#157; cells. The blood act as the highway from the GA to the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick cells.&acirc;&euro;&#157; Once the specific package arrives, it is opened and all of the inside constituents are released in close proximity to the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick&acirc;&euro;&#157; cell. Then Proxeronine, under the influence of Proxeroninase, a substance found naturally in the body, is converted to Xeronine (an alkaloid). Xeronine combines with the correct mixtures of bio chemicals to create the specific adaptogen for that particular &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick&acirc;&euro;&#157; cell. In the H-S theory, the limiting factor is P or Proxeronine. If there is not enough Proxeronine then the GA will not assemble the right package to be sent to the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick&acirc;&euro;&#157; cells and there will be no combining of Proxeronine with Proxeroninase to create the cell-rebuilding substance called Xeronine. Fortunately, the factor P can be controlled by an individual increasing his or her intake of Noni, which contains the highest natural concentration of P. In addition to bringing &acirc;&euro;&oelig;sick&acirc;&euro;&#157; cells back into homeostasis, Xeronine helps to boost the function of normal cells. Non-sick cells also need different amounts of Xeronine and other biochemicals, depending on their function. When the body has an adequate amount of Proxeronine to supply and replenish the necessary xeronine this help to keep energy levels high and to ward off potential disease. This is called prevention. It is because of the great preventive character. Noni is highly recommended to the healthy people too. Noni makes healthy people stay healthier always.<br />
        Combine taking adequate of Proxeronine, through Real Noni with a good diet , exercise, and positive thinking and yours mat be the next story found in a book about healthy, happy people such as this one. It is very much possible to increase the quality of your life with Indian NONI, the ultimate health Enhancer.</p>
